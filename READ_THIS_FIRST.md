### Source code project
This source code Maven project generated by Transformation Advisor enables you to make changes to your application before migrating it to Liberty. The analysis document and report available in Transformation Advisor describe the changes necessary for a successful migration. If you are using Eclipse, the [IBM WebSphere Migration Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mw-1701-was-migration/index.html) makes source code updates easier. The toolkit is available in the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/).
 
 ### How the bundle helps with modernization
 
  - Provides files that are necessary for containerization, accelerating the deployment to Liberty.
  
  - Allows you to make and test changes to your application in a container in your local environment.
- Provides the resources necessary to deploy your application to an OpenShift cluster using an operator.

 ### Documentation & support
 For more information and instructions on how to use this software see the IBM Knowledge Center [manual link](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5Q6W/welcome.html). 

To build and deploy using Accelerator for Teams - go to the migration plan page in Transformation Advisor and select the option to use Accelerator for Teams, before downloading or pushing the bundle to Git. Accelerator for Teams was derived from the Kabanero.io software, for more details on using this feature see [Kabanero.io documentation](https://kabanero.io/docs/).
